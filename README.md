# Linear-algebra
Some simple routines for dealing with vectors and bases in vector spaces
  * algebra.ipynb 	- jupyter notebook version of matrix_algebra.py
	* ma_testing.py 	- unittest for matrix_algebra. to be modified, use np.linalg.norm for testing
	* matrix_algebra.py - main module. Gram-Schmidt ortogonalization, composition/decomposition of a vector in given basis, transition matrix from base to base
